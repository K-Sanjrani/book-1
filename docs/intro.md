# Welcome to Physical AI Book 🤖

Learn to build sensor-based systems and bring AI to the physical world.

## What is This?

**Physical AI Book** is a hands-on learning guide for beginners and intermediate developers who want to:

- ✅ Understand what Physical AI is and why it matters
- ✅ Read sensor data and make decisions based on real-world inputs
- ✅ Build working IoT projects on Raspberry Pi
- ✅ Deploy decision logic to edge devices
- ✅ Go from simulator to real hardware at your own pace

## Who This Is For

### 🔰 Beginners
- Basic programming knowledge (Python loops, functions)
- No AI/ML background required
- Want to learn by doing, not just reading

### 🚀 Intermediate Developers
- Want to apply Physical AI concepts to projects
- Ready to move from theory to real-world applications
- Interested in IoT and edge computing

### 👨‍🏫 Instructors
- Looking for curriculum with working examples
- Need grading rubrics and checkpoint solutions
- Want students to learn through hands-on practice

## What You'll Learn

### Chapter 1: Physical AI Fundamentals (Now Available)

**Lesson 1.1: What is Physical AI?** (~30 min)
- Define Physical AI and differentiate from traditional AI
- Explore real-world applications (smart homes, robotics, environmental monitoring)
- Understand the hardware-software interaction model
- Run your first sensor example (simulator-based)

**Lesson 1.2: Understanding Sensors** (~45 min)
- Learn common sensor types (temperature, motion, light, pressure)
- Understand analog vs. digital signals
- Read multiple sensors and log data to CSV
- Complete checkpoint: Add a new sensor type

**Lesson 1.3: Building Your First Project** (~60 min)
- Design a smart room monitoring system
- Integrate multiple sensors with decision logic
- Implement "if-then" rules for automation
- Run on real Raspberry Pi (optional)
- Complete checkpoint: Extend with humidity and comfort zones

**Total Time**: 2-3 hours + optional hardware exploration

### Future Chapters (Planned v2.0+)
- **Chapter 2**: Home Automation Project (multi-sensor coordination, logging, alerts)
- **Chapter 3**: Real-World IoT Systems (cloud integration, data analysis, deployment)
