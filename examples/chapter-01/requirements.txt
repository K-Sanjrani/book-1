# Python dependencies for Physical AI Book - Chapter 1 Examples
# Pinned to known-good versions for reproducibility (see FR-024)
# Last updated: 2025-12-09

# Testing framework
pytest==7.4.0
pytest-cov==4.1.0

# Hardware interaction (cross-platform compatible)
# For Raspberry Pi, install: sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio
# For simulator mode, standard library mocking is used
RPi.GPIO==0.7.0; sys_platform == 'linux'

# Sensor libraries (simulator-compatible)
Adafruit-DHT==1.2.3; sys_platform == 'linux'

# Data handling
numpy==1.24.3  # For optional data analysis in extended examples

# Standard library imports used (no additional packages needed):
# - json (for config files)
# - time (for timing/delays)
# - csv (for data logging)
# - os (for file operations)
# - unittest.mock (for testing)

# Notes:
# - RPi.GPIO and Adafruit-DHT are only installed on Linux (Raspberry Pi)
# - For development on macOS/Windows, mock sensors are used automatically
# - If you get import errors on non-Pi systems, that's expected - use simulator mode
# - To upgrade: pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
# - To check versions: pip list | grep -E "pytest|RPi|Adafruit"
